<h3 class="projectHeader">Workout Log</h3>

<p class="projectDesc">
  I wanted to make a lightweight, easy to use, workout tracker that
  had only the necessary features. Add exercises to a workout with a
  title, and set number, then specify weight and reps. There is even
  an option to add notes for each exercise.

<p class="projectDesc">
  I used izitoast, my favorite modal / popup library to help make
  inputting data easy and intuitive. This is a good candidate to be
  re-build with MERN. Currently it is only using localstorage.
